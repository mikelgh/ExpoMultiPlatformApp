# Electron mirror configuration
# Note: electron_mirror and electron_builder_binaries_mirror are NOT valid npm config options
# These should be set via environment variables instead
# 
# The fix-install.ps1 script automatically sets these environment variables:
# - ELECTRON_MIRROR
# - ELECTRON_BUILDER_BINARIES_MIRROR
#
# If you need to set them manually, use:
# $env:ELECTRON_MIRROR="https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/"
# $env:ELECTRON_BUILDER_BINARIES_MIRROR="https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron-builder-binaries/"
